# A Reaction-Diffusion Model of ROS-Induced ROS Release in a Mitochondrial Network

:::success
**Idea**
The mitochondiral network was aligned in the fixed position and numbers. However, mitochondrial network is a dynamic process both on the persepectives of fission-fusion process, autophagy and movement.

The physical location and network stuctures vary over time to time, the oscillation of mitochondrial membrane potential must be under certain parameter sets including mitochondrial mass, fission fussion frequency and speed of movement

*It doesn't seem like mitochondrial physcial change happens in mycardial cell*
