# Eroom's law 
the financial funding drops every year

# Human pluripotent stem cell cardiomycote

# hpsc-cm immaturity limits application

Conventional culture model is two dimensional culture

multi-scale cardiac tissue engineering

The heart has a complex, helical stucture

engineering scaffold-free 3D tissues with layer-by-layer architectural control
* aligned
* orthogonal 
* angled

The gel casting method to preserve cell sheet anisotropy and control relative layer angle during stacking

# Engineering functional units of myocardium

# Used for cardiotoxicity screening

pro-arrythmia is 
* existing regulation costly and overly conservative
* cardiotoxicity screen market exceeds 1.5B growing 20%/year

# Nanotopographically 

Naflon coated MEA
PUA
ComboMat
hPSC-CMs

# Model Duchenn dystrophy

Animal model
* mdx mouse
* Dystrophy dog

**Fail for clinical trial**

**Nanopatterned hiPSC-based model** of dystrophic cardiomyophy

DMD model fails clinical trials

Nitrendipine reduces

# Moving forwards
* combo maturation
* exaggerated disease phenotype
* nerve innervated heart on chip technology

Epicardial electionics + nanopatterned scaffold = theranostic cardiac patch

> Anisotropy /ˌænaɪˈsɒtrəpi/ is the property of being directionally dependent, which implies different properties in different directions, as opposed to isotropy. It can be defined as a difference, when measured along different axes, in a material's physical or mechanical properties (absorbance, refractive index, conductivity, tensile strength, etc.)
